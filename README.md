## 👋 Hi there 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm nitin, and I'm passionate about data science education, particularly adult education and e-learning platforms! 
When not working, I enjoy bouldering and planning holidays. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions.

## 🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently focused on developing e-learning platforms based on GenAI that facilitate hyper-personalized learning paths in the fields of AI and data science.
I'm excited to expand my skills in software development, specifically MLOps.

## 🚀 Projects

- [sequence-modelling](https://github.com/nbhushan/sequence-modelling): numerically optimised sequence modelling in Python 🐍
- [causal-discovery](https://github.com/nbhushan/causal-discovery): benchmarking causal discovery methods 📊
- [data-science slidedecks](https://github.com/nbhushan/data-science-slidedecks/tree/main/Explainable%20AI): jargon free data science decks 👨‍🏫
- [python-app-template](https://github.com/nbhushan/python-poetry-CI-template): a poetry based python project template with continous integration 🔨
  
Feel free to explore more projects in my repo and provide any feedback or suggestions.
