## 👋 Hi there 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm nitin, and I'm passionate about data science education, particularly upskilling domain experts and e-learning platforms! 
When not working, I enjoy bouldering and planning holidays. Here you'll find some of my projects and contributions. I've worked in the past for organisations ranging from education (University of Groningen, Breda University of applied sciences), manufacturing (Bosch), and AI (Naver Labs-XRCE).

## 🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently focused on developing e-learning platforms based on GenAI that facilitate hyper-personalized learning paths in the fields of AI and data science.
I'm excited to expand my skills in software development, specifically MLOps.
